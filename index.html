		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This tool allows create a simple RF system cascade. You may view things such as cascaded noise figure, cascaded linearity (IP3, IP2, P1dB), electronic gain, aperture gain, EIRP, and other parameters.</p>
		<p>RF cascade analysis is very commonly done in an Excel document. Many companies have their own preferred Excel document; my goal here is to create a simple, accessible online tool to verify calculations or for new engineers to learn. At first glance, there's a lot going on; take some time to learn the way I'm visualizing the information and allow the user to control what is being viewed. I think you'll enjoy using the tool and I hope you share it with others.</p>
		<p>This tool was created by <a href="https://github.com/jasondurbin" target="_blank">Jason Durbin</a>, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasondurbin/" target="_blank">free-lancing phased array engineer</a>.
		<h2>Usage and Terminology</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>System blocks may be added using "Add Block". The block <strong>Type</strong> controls how the backend treats it during the cascade. There are multiple types:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Active</strong> - Control gain, noise figure, and linearity settings.</li>
					<li><strong>Passive</strong> - Control gain and linearity settings. Gain must be less than 0 and the noise figure is directly related to gain.</li>
					<li><strong>Corporate Combiner</strong> - This block requires the system direction to be "RX". An extra parameter appears ("inputs/outputs"). For example, a 2-way would be have 2 inputs. Gain is the insertion loss of the device <strong>not including the split loss</strong>. During system calculation, this block assumes the signal is coherent and noise is incoherent. Therefore, this block should <strong>improve</strong> SNR. Additionally, this block increases element count (and therefore aperture gain). Note, if your system is not a phased array, this block is unneccessary.</li>
					<li><strong>Corporate Divider</strong> - This block is reciprocal of "Corporate Combiner" for TX. Similarly, gain must be insertion loss <strong>not including split loss</strong>. Unlike the combiner, noise and signal power are not treated differently through this block. Note, if your system is not a phased array, this block is unneccessary.</li>
					<li><strong>Combiner</strong> - A combiner that is not treated special. Element count is not affected by it. Loss through the combiner is the number of inputs + gain. Essentially this is an amplifier with linear gain equal to the number of inputs.</li>
					<li><strong>Divider</strong> - This block is reciprocal of "Combiner". This block is essentially a passive lossy device.</li>
					<li><strong>Antenna</strong> - A special block that increases aperture gain, signal gain, but not electronic gain or noise figure - essentially an antenna with perfect radiation efficiency. If you have radiation efficiency, consider adding a passive block immediately following the antenna. Antennas should be the first element in RX or last element in RX.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Single Path vs Coherent</strong><p>In this tool, I carry terms for <strong>single path</strong> noise figure and gain and <strong>coherent</strong> noise figure and gain. This distinction only applies when looking at and RX system. <strong>Coherent</strong> implies that all devices prior to corporate combiner are all operating identically and their noise is random; therefore, the signals add coherent (in power) and the noise adds incoherently (in voltage). <strong>Single path</strong> is the performance if all elements are off <i>except</i> for one. For example, single path gain is what you'd measure with a network analyzer connected to one input.</p></li>
			<li><strong>Electronic gain vs array gain vs signal gain</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Signal gain</strong> is simply the how much the signal power has increased through the system. All devices impact the signal gain.</li>
					<li><strong>Array gain</strong> is simplified directivity estimate of the array. Some people carry this number as negative noise figure (because that's what it is).</li>
					<li><strong>Electronic gain</strong> is the gain of all the devices that contribute to noise. If you remember from Pozar, the noise at the output of a device = <code>g_linear*(kTB + noise_input)</code>. For a phased array, the gain in that equation (<code>g_linear</code>) is electronic gain.</li>
					<li>More simply, if you were to replace the entire phased array with a single amplifier and a single antenna, the amplifier would have a gain equal to <strong>electronic gain</strong> (and a noise figure equal to <strong>coherent noise figure</strong>), the antenna would have a directivity equal to <strong>array gain</strong>, and the signal from left to right (or vise-versa) would increase by the <strong>signal gain</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>System globals control things like system temperature, direction, bandwidth (for noise), input signal power, and input noise temperature.</li>
			<li>Columns can be rearranged or hidden as necessary.</li>
			<li>You can add system plots for most columns.</li>
			<li>Hover the column header or column selectors to show a description of the parameter.</li>
			<li>The Y-axis of plots is controlled by the unit selected in the column. Changing the unit of a column will change the unit of the plot.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This tool is not intended to replace more advanced system simulation tools.</li>
			<li>While I try my best to test every feature and verify the mathematics, there's a potential of errors. If you see one, contact me.</li>
			<li>This tool uses a delicate balance of saving raw data to URL (or clipboard). Sometimes, random errors may occur. If you happen to be able to replicate an error, contact me!</li>
